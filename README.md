Excercise 1.
1st normal form.
I dont see any violation to the rules of this normal form
2nd normal form.
We find that the rules of this normal form is violated due to the fact that not all non key values is direclty related to the primary ID. 
3rd normal form.

Excercise 2.

One could set the the contact number as the primary key to acces the exact customer. The violations of the normalforms wouldnt be any different.
